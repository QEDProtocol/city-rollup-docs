# Overview
CityRollup uses a massively parallel proving system that distributes proving tasks to workers who generate proofs to complete the block.

## Animation
import VideoCon from '@site/src/components/Video/VideoCon';

<VideoCon src="/video/arch-parallel-proving.mp4" />

In the animation above, you can see how proofs are proved in parallel to generate a single block transition proof in O(log(n)) time.
