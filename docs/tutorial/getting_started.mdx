# Getting Started


## Dependencies
To setup City Rollup, you first need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once docker is installed, clone the City Rollup repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QEDProtocol/city-rollup
cd city-rollup
make build
```

After City Rollup is installed, you can spin up a minimal instance of CityRollup with the following commands:
```bash
make relaunch
make run-rpc-server
make run-orchestrator
make run-api-server
make run-l2-worker
```
