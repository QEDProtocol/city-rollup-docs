# Getting Started


## Dependencies
Before installing City Rollup, you should check that all of the following tools are installed.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Then you should download a pre-generated file for `bls12_381`.

``` shell
wget https://city.qed.me/alpha/v1/cr-trusted-setup.zip 
rm -rf ~/.city-rollup/keystore 
mkdir -p ~/.city-rollup/keystore 
unzip cr-trusted-setup.zip -d ~/.city-rollup/keystore 
#rm cr-trusted-setup.zip 
```
After completing the above preparations, clone the City Rollup repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/QEDProtocol/city-rollup
cd city-rollup
make build
```

After compiling City Rollup, you can start the smallest instance of City Rollup with the following command:

Note: You need to run the last three commands in different terminal windows.
```bash
make relaunch
make run-rpc-server
make run-orchestrator
make run-l2-worker
```

Now that City Rollup is up and running, you can use it by following the example below, or reading the documentation on `User Wallet/CLI`
* Send command to produce the next block and dispatch proving tasks to workers
```bash
make cr_produce_block
```
* Register two users on L2
```bash
make cr_register_user
```
* Deposit funds from Dogecoin to L2
```bash
make cr_l1_deposit #please copy the txid
```
* Produce another block to mark the deposits as claimable on L2
```bash
make cr_produce_block
```
* Claim deposited funds
```bash
make TXID=... cr_claim_deposit #no 0x prefix
```
* Transfer claimed funds from to another
```bash
make cr_token_transfer
```
* Produce another block
```bash

```
